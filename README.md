This is an Inventory Management System made using Django.

In first section I made master models for my General Store Inventory Management System.

Master Models are:
(a) Vendor
(b) Unit
(c) Product

In second section i used Jazzmin Admin UI to replace default django admin UI and created another models:
(a) Purchase Model
(b) Sale Model
(c) Inventory Model
